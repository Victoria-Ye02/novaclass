// values as UTC with no offset conversion — the two must agree, or every
// stored timestamp silently drifts by the server's UTC offset. Forcing the
// session itself to UTC on every connection is what makes them agree: the
// app always stores and returns real UTC, and each viewer's browser
// converts it to their own local time for display (the standard approach).
